## What Is It?

An artificial intelligence image detection application, that allows and takes the users imported .jpg image file and returns a processed image that indicates by using square outlines showing which item it is classifying.

## How It Works?

**Step 1:** The user must login/make an account to use the application.

**Step 2:** Once accepted, the user will be sent to the home page and have many choices (upload an image, logout, refresh page, check logs, check classification list). If user chooses the upload an image button, the user's computer files will open up and they will ask to import an image to be processed. If check logs has been chosen the user will see the login logs and processed images logs. The Classification List allows the users to see what types of images the AI is capable of processing.
